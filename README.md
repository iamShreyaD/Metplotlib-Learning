# Metplotlib-Learning

This repository documents my hands-on practice with the Pandas library using a publicly available tutorial.

It includes: • Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a sample CSV dataset • Data manipulation using functions such as groupby, indexing, and aggregation • Data cleaning and preprocessing (dropping irrelevant columns, handling missing data, fixing inconsistent values, standardizing text, fixing data types, removing duplicates) • Well-structured Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) demonstrating step-by-step transformations

The attached Data.csv file is the source dataset used in the notebook.
